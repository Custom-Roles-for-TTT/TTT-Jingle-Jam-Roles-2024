# _Custom Roles for TTT_ Roles Pack for Jingle Jam 2024
A pack of [Custom Roles for TTT](https://github.com/Custom-Roles-for-TTT/TTT-Custom-Roles) roles created based on the generous donations of our community members in support of [Jingle Jam 2024](https://www.jinglejam.co.uk/).

# Roles

## Barrel Mimic
_Suggested By_: Corvatile\
The Barrel Mimic is a jester role that can transform into a barrel. If their barrel is exploded and kills another player, they win!
\
\
**ConVars**
```cpp
ttt_barrelmimic_enabled             0   // Whether or not the barrel mimic should spawn
ttt_barrelmimic_spawn_weight        1   // The weight assigned to spawning the barrel mimic
ttt_barrelmimic_min_players         0   // The minimum number of players required to spawn the barrel mimic
ttt_barrelmimic_starting_health     100 // The amount of health the barrel mimic starts with
ttt_barrelmimic_max_health          100 // The maximum amount of health the barrel mimic can have
ttt_barrelmimic_announce            1   // Whether to announce that there is a barrel mimic
ttt_barrelmimic_respawn_all_deaths  1   // Whether to respawn when the Barrel Mimic is killed in any way. If disabled, they will only respawn when killed as a barrel
ttt_barrelmimic_respawn_delay       15  // The delay before the Barrel Mimic is killed without winning the round. If set to 0, they will not respawn
